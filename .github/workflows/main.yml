# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  checkout:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: espressif/idf:release-v4.0
      volumes:
        - .:/project

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        submodules: recursive

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: List the repository content
